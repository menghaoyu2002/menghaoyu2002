## Hey There :wave:
My name is Menghao Yu. I make silly projects in my free time.

- :mortar_board: I'm currently a second year computer science student at UofT.
- :computer: I enjoy learning a bunch of different programming languages. My favourites are Python, Kotlin, Javascript, and Golang.
- :mag: I am currently exploring all the different career paths related to software engineering to find the one I truly love.
- :floppy_disk: I enjoy tinkering with computer software, and customizing UI's to my liking
- :hourglass: I would like to eventually: 
  - make a game engine
  - make a gameboy/nds emulator
  - learn Rust
  - learn React Native + Flutter
  - learn some computer engineering and work with hardware
- I just want to learn a little bit of everything so I can do a little bit of everything. 

#### :fire: I am currently looking for Summer 2022 Internship Opportunities :fire:
